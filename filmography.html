            <p>Overwhelmed by her boyfriend's endless niceness, Kate wrestles with guilt through vivid daydreams of puppies, pistols, and shoot-outs.<br><br> Breaking up has never felt so cruel as it does for Kate, whose boyfriend Michael is impossibly nice.

What follows is a whirlwind of noir-inspired fantasies where breakups turn into standoffs, jazz soundtracks swell, and boyfriends bite the dust. Along the way, Kate must learn staying honest with herself doesn't make her a villian; it makes her strong.<br><br>A National Film School at IADT Film, starring Rebecca Whelan as Kate, Daisy Moon as Beth, and Max Henderickson as the impossibly nice Michael.
